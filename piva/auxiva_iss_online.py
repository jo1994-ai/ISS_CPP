Online AuxIVA-ISS: a frame-recursive counterpart to the batch
auxiva_iss_py in auxiva_iss.py.

Unlike the batch algorithm, which is handed the full STFT of a
recording and repeatedly sweeps over every time frame to converge,
this version processes one incoming STFT frame at a time and updates
its state causally:

  - It keeps a running, exponentially-forgotten estimate of each
    source's spatial covariance (``U``), instead of the exact
    statistics over the whole recording the batch version can afford.
  - It applies only a handful of ISS iterations per new frame (``n_iter``,
    typically 1-5), instead of dozens of sweeps over the entire signal.
  - Frame t's output only ever depends on frames <= t, so this is
    suitable (algorithmically) for streaming/low-latency use, whereas
    the batch version needs the entire recording up front.

To exercise/validate it here, this function still takes a full
pre-computed STFT array as input and loops over its frame axis, but it
never looks ahead: it only ever reads X[t] to produce output frame t,
exactly reproducing what would happen if frames arrived one at a time.

    Online blind source separation based on independent vector analysis
    with recursive iterative source steering updates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: ndarray (n_frames, n_freq, n_chan)
        STFT representation of the mixture. Frames are consumed one at
        a time, in order, to emulate streaming operation.
    n_src: int, optional
        The number of sources. Only the determined case (n_src ==
        n_chan) is supported, as in the batch auxiva_iss_py.
    n_iter: int, optional
        Number of ISS iterations applied per incoming frame (default 3).
        Unlike the batch algorithm, this need not be large: convergence
        happens gradually across frames as the recursive statistics
        accumulate, not within a single frame.
    alpha: float, optional
        Forgetting factor for the recursive per-source covariance
        (default 0.96). Closer to 1 means slower adaptation but more
        stable estimates; closer to 0 adapts faster to changing
        conditions (e.g. moving sources) but is noisier.
    model: str
        'laplace' (default) or 'gauss' source model, same as the batch
        implementation.
    proj_back: bool, optional
        Whether to apply the standard (batch) projection-back scaling
        to the full output at the end.
    W0: ndarray (n_freq, n_chan, n_chan), optional
        Initial demixing matrices. Defaults to the identity per
        frequency bin.
    U0: ndarray (n_src, n_freq, n_chan, n_chan), optional
        Initial per-source spatial covariance estimates. Defaults to a
        small multiple of the identity per source/frequency.
    callback: callable, optional
        If given, called as ``callback(y_t, t)`` after each frame is
        processed, with ``y_t`` of shape (n_freq, n_src).

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray (n_frames, n_freq, n_src)
        The separated signal, computed causally frame by frame.
